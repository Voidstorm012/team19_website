                            This project looks at how we can use gamification to make the CommuniMap platform more engaging. CommuniMap is a digital tool that lets users log their walking or cycling routes. Our goal is to add fun and rewarding features like streaks, virtual pets, and leaderboards to encourage people to use the app more regularly. We started by speaking with users to understand what motivates them, then built early prototypes in Figma to test different ideas. Through this process, we’re exploring how to make the app not just useful, but also enjoyable and something people want to come back to.

                        <p>The current version of CommuniMap lacks features that keep users engaged over time. While the platform allows people to log their walking and cycling routes, users often lose interest due to limited interactivity and a lack of feedback or rewards. Without meaningful motivation, even the most well-intentioned users stop contributing, reducing the platform's long-term value as a community tool.</p>

                <div class="week-content">
                    <p>In our first week, we began exploring how to improve the CommuniMap platform by speaking to stakeholders and designing our first prototype. Our goal was to understand real user needs and shape a solution grounded in evidence.</p>
                    
                    <div class="week-section">
                        <h3>🔍 What We Asked (and Why)</h3>
                        <p>To understand the challenges and opportunities, we focused our stakeholder interviews around:</p>
                        <ul class="week-list">
                            <li><strong>Route Logging:</strong> Is it accurate and reliable?</li>
                            <li><strong>Travel Modes:</strong> Are the current options inclusive for all types of movement?</li>
                            <li><strong>Gamification:</strong> Is it visible and motivating enough?</li>
                            <li><strong>CO₂ Tracking:</strong> Could it be reintroduced in a meaningful, cost-effective way?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These questions helped us identify what users valued — and what the system was missing.</p>

                    <div class="week-section">
                        <h3>💡 What We Learned</h3>
                        <p>Our biggest insights from Week 1:</p>
                        <ul class="week-list">
                            <li><strong>Don't start from scratch</strong> — we should improve the existing platform, not reinvent it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Visibility matters</strong> — if users don't see a feature, it might as well not exist.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gamification needs purpose</strong> — points alone aren't enough.</li>
                            <li><strong>Emotional connection boosts engagement</strong> — people connect with things that feel personal.</li>

                        <h3>🧭 How It Shaped Our Design</h3>
                        <p>This early user research fundamentally shifted how we approached the project. Instead of designing based on assumptions, we began prioritizing based on what stakeholders actually cared about. It reminded us how valuable co-design and user feedback are — not just for validating ideas, but for focusing our efforts where they matter most.</p>

                    <div class="week-section">
                        <h3>🧪 Our First Prototype</h3>
                        <p>We created a low-fidelity prototype to explore how these insights could be applied. Here's a quick before-and-after snapshot of how user feedback transformed our design:</p>

                    <div class="week-section">
                        <h3>🗣️ What We Asked Stakeholders</h3>
                        <p>Some of the key questions we used to guide our interviews:</p>
                        <ul class="week-list">
                            <li>What frustrates users about the current CommuniMap experience?</li>
                            <li>What features have been tried before, and why did they succeed or fail?</li>
                            <li>What motivates users to engage with the platform?</li>
                            <li>What types of gamification or incentives have worked in the past?</li>
                            <li>What CO₂ metrics are meaningful to them?</li>
                            <li>Are there technical or data limitations we should be aware of?</li>
                            <li>Could external services like Strava or NextBike help enrich the experience?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These questions helped us uncover gaps in functionality and spark ideas for new features — like reintroducing CO₂ tracking with better communication and designing gamified interactions that feel rewarding and visible.</p>

                    <div class="week-section">
                        <h3>✨ Reflection</h3>
                        <p>Week 1 taught us that great design isn't just about adding new features — it's about understanding what already exists, listening deeply to users, and finding simple, purposeful ways to improve their experience.</p>
