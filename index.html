                            This project is part of GALLANT‚Äôs wider efforts to promote sustainable travel in Glasgow and
                            tracking the CO‚ÇÇ offsets achieved when users choose walking or cycling over motorised
                            transport.
                            CommuniMap is a digital platform that allows users to log walking and cycling routes,
                            supporting low-carbon travel habits and community research.
                            Our work explores how to enhance CommuniMap through gamification to make the experience more
                            engaging. We framed the design process around a clear problem of low long-term user
                            engagement, and used iterative design thinking and stakeholder input to develop and refine
                            features like virtual pets, rewards, and streak systems. These additions are designed to
                            create a more motivating and meaningful user experience.

                <div class="problem-statement">
                        <p>From our stakeholder discussions, we learned that CommuniMap‚Äôs current gamification features such as badges and a leaderboard are too hidden and fail to engage users. To encourage consistent contributions, gamification needs to be fun, visible, and habit-forming, taking inspiration from successful apps like Duolingo with tiered leaderboards, streak systems, and group achievements. While vouchers have been effective in the past, they are not sustainable as the sole motivator, so creative, non-monetary rewards such as in-app recognition and unlockable milestones should also be considered. Above all, features should remain simple, easy to find, and intuitive to use to maximise their impact.</p>

                        <p>The current version of CommuniMap lacks features that keep users engaged over time. While the platform allows people to log their walking and cycling routes, users often lose interest due to limited interactivity and a lack of feedback or rewards. Speaking to the client, we found out that while some gamification features like leaderboards already exist, they are hidden or underutilized. Without meaningful motivation or visible feedback, even the most well-intentioned users stop contributing, reducing the platform's long-term value as a community tool.</p>

                                    We explored several gamified and sustainability-focused apps to identify best
                                    practices and gaps. Duolingo inspired our use of tiered leaderboards and streak
                                    systems to encourage daily engagement. Pok√©mon Go demonstrated how 2D/3D hybrid maps
                                    and location-based interactions can turn movement into an immersive experience.
                                    LumiHealth showed the effectiveness of daily challenges and earning coins that can
                                    be redeemed for real-world rewards. However, most platforms lacked visible CO‚ÇÇ
                                    impact gaps we aimed to address with CommuniMap.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <p>We began the project by interpreting the brief through the lens of CO‚ÇÇ tracking.
                                Initially, we focused on researching the best ways to calculate and visualize carbon
                                savings, thinking this would create the most impact. However, after speaking with our
                                stakeholder, we realised this wasn't the app‚Äôs core problem.</p>


                            <p>The real issue was around engagement. Features like badges and leaderboards already
                                existed, but were buried or felt disconnected from the user's experience. This shifted
                                our focus: instead of adding new elements blindly, we asked ourselves how we could make
                                features feel purposeful, visible, and emotionally meaningful.</p>
                            <p>We explored existing gamification approaches ‚Äî like reward loops, pet companions, social
                                progression ‚Äî and analysed why some failed while others worked. From this, we drafted
                                several ideas before narrowing it down to five final features that best balanced
                                motivation, usability, and feasibility.</p>

                            <!-- <p>We also learned the importance of shared understanding. Terms like "fun" or "rewarding"
                                meant different things to different people, so we had to align our ideas before moving
                                forward. We reintroduced CO‚ÇÇ tracking as a conceptual metric based on stakeholder
                                approval. While not currently implemented due to cost, we included it in our design with
                                simplified assumptions to demonstrate potential.</p> -->

                            <p>Once we understood that the core issue wasn‚Äôt just a lack of features, but the lack of
                                visible and meaningful engagement, we aligned on a clearer direction: to enhance
                                intuitiveness and motivation without overwhelming users.
                            </p>

                            <p>We created low-fidelity mockups and interactive Figma screens to prototype ideas such as
                                app-following pets, daily streaks, visible rewards, and achievement popups. These ideas
                                aimed to make sustainable actions feel rewarding in a more obvious, interactive way.

                            </p>

                            <p> This wasn‚Äôt just about designing visuals, building prototypes helped us figure out what
                                actually felt intuitive,
                                fun, or confusing. Some concepts looked good on paper but fell flat in testing.
                                Interestingly, simpler elements
                                like visible streak counters, progress feedback, or small positive reinforcements turned
                                out to be more effective than larger,
                                more complex ideas.</p>

                            <p>We shared our designs with our stakeholder and gathered feedback. This helped us refine
                                the direction further and focus on what really worked.</p>

                            <p>In this phase, we moved from mid-fidelity concepts to high-fidelity designs, focusing on
                                refining both the interface and the overall user experience. We cleaned up the layout,
                                improved navigation flow, and worked on making key features like the leaderboard easier
                                to access. The tone of the app shifted to be more playful while maintaining clarity and
                                usability.</p>

                            <p>At this stage, we produced what we considered our second final implementation a
                                near-complete set of Figma mockups that brought together our chosen features with the
                                CommuniMap brand style before comfirming with the client one last time. However, after
                                reviewing this version, we identified areas for further refinement, such as more
                                cohesive visual hierarchy, improved accessibility, and smoother micro-interactions.</p>

                            <p>We also carefully balanced creativity with real-world limitations like technical
                                feasibility, ensuring our ideas could be realistically implemented. The result was a
                                polished design that not only looked good but also felt intuitive and rewarding to use.

                            <p>Our interactions with Sarah from the GALLANT team was central to shaping our direction,
                                clearing ambiguities, and driving us toward an evidence-based, feasible, and engaging
                                solution. The conversations didn‚Äôt just help us refine a prototype, they fundamentally
                                transformed our understanding of what our role was, what constraints existed, and what
                                possibilities we could pursue within and beyond those constraints.
                            </p>

                            <div class="reflection-point">
                                <h4>From Ambiguity to Clarity</h4>
                                <p>Before our first meeting with Sarah, we had developed a general idea that our
                                    solution should increase user engagement and long-term participation in CommuniMap.
                                    However, the scope was unclear: Were we improving the existing app? Proposing an
                                    entirely new platform? Should we research carbon dioxide calculations? Were there
                                    existing methods they preferred? These foundational uncertainties were addressed
                                    immediately during the first stakeholder meeting.
                                </p>
                                <p>We learned that the app was developed externally and that direct backend access or
                                    structural changes were not permitted. ‚ÄúWe can't make any changes to this,‚Äù Sarah
                                    explained about the Spotteron platform, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd get in trouble if I gave you the
                                    login.‚Äù This clarified that our focus should be on conceptual enhancements, ideally
                                    imagined in a ‚Äúfuture version‚Äù of the platform, assuming unlimited time and budget.
                                    This subtle but important constraint narrowed our approach while simultaneously
                                    encouraging creative freedom within realistic boundaries.
                                </p>
                                <p>It also helped us see that the deliverable wasn‚Äôt a deployable product; it was a
                                    vision of what could be, should the infrastructure and funding become available. We
                                    were free to explore bold ideas, map out ideal user journeys, and reimagine the
                                    app‚Äôs potential through sketches, mockups, and interaction flows. This early
                                    boundary-setting allowed us to confidently shift from development mode to conceptual
                                    design mode and better frame our proposal‚Äôs purpose.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="reflection-point">
                                <h4>Co-Exploring Ideas Together</h4>
                                <p>A significant part of our engagement with Sarah was the co-exploration of ideas,
                                    where feedback loops occurred in real-time. Rather than presenting fixed features,
                                    we collaboratively discussed options such as pet-based progression systems, streak
                                    mechanics with improved leaderboard, and gamified rewards.
                                </p>
                                <p>For example, when we showed our initial concept, drawing inspiration from Pok√©mon Go
                                    with a pet cow avatar, challenges, and point-based CO‚ÇÇ tracking, we were met with
                                    enthusiasm but also a balanced perspective. Sarah helped us weigh the trade-offs:
                                    ‚ÄúIf you're too forward with the educational element, people get bored,‚Äù she noted,
                                    but ‚Äúif you're too playful, people may lose sight of the core purpose.‚Äù She also
                                    raised a critical point: what if some users simply wanted to use the app as a tool,
                                    not as a game? This prompted us to consider different user types and design with
                                    flexibility in mind, ensuring the experience could remain functional and meaningful
                                    even for those not motivated by gamification.
                                </p>
                                <p>This conversation opened space to explore the delicate balance between engagement and
                                    intention. Together, we asked: Could a pet system foster emotional investment
                                    without turning the app into a game? Would leaderboards encourage healthy
                                    competition or alienate users who weren‚Äôt as active? These were not hypothetical
                                    questions‚Äîwe explored them through back-and-forth discussion, testing not just what
                                    sounded good, but what aligned with the behavioural goals of the project.
                                </p>
                                <p>Sarah offered alternative motivators we hadn‚Äôt initially considered, such as an event
                                    pop-up tab when users login, especially helpful since ongoing events were only
                                    visible on the map and often overlooked by users. She affirmed our ideas of
                                    real-world incentives, such as bike rental vouchers, could strongly encourage
                                    cycling and reinforce the app‚Äôs sustainability goals. This broadened our
                                    understanding of motivation beyond digital feedback and into real-world rewards.
                                    These insights directly shaped how we structured the points, streaks, and
                                    event-triggered features in our solution.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="reflection-point">
                                <h4>Insights That Shaped Our Design</h4>
                                <p>One of the biggest takeaways from our conversations was how varied user motivations
                                    could be. Some users are data-driven and want to contribute meaningfully. Others
                                    might use the app once and abandon it if they don‚Äôt find it engaging. ‚ÄúThe biggest
                                    challenge is retention,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSome will open it once, think it‚Äôs boring, and
                                    never open it again.‚Äù
                                </p>
                                <p>This prompted us to think deeply about first impressions, daily engagement cues, and
                                    meaningful longevity. From this, we designed subtle nudges like daily streak icons,
                                    dynamic pets, and challenge reminders. These weren‚Äôt just features, they were direct
                                    responses to our stakeholder‚Äôs concern that ‚Äúthe gamification element is buried‚Äù and
                                    should be more visible. We translated this feedback into a more prominent user
                                    interface that foregrounds rewards and progress the moment the user opens the app.
                                </p>
                                <p>Another critical insight was around feasibility. While we floated ideas like AR-based
                                    pet interaction, Sarah grounded the discussion: ‚ÄúThat would be a fun concept, but
                                    way over the top, not feasible.‚Äù (She did say it would be really cool.) Rather than
                                    dismissing the idea, she reframed it, suggesting we keep the concept but strip it
                                    down to its emotionally resonant core, like animations and small celebratory
                                    effects. This helped us build a design that feels alive and interactive, even if
                                    limited by technical feasibility.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>What stood out most about the interaction with Sarah was the tone of mutual respect
                                    and open-minded collaboration. Instead of critiquing from a distance, Sarah engaged
                                    deeply with our prototypes, even suggesting improvements to UI layout, leaderboard
                                    visibility, and content accessibility. She shared brand guidelines, explained the
                                    app‚Äôs architectural limitations, and offered creative workarounds such as
                                    integrating our prototype into a companion site or exploring reward partnerships
                                    with local vendors.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This partnership gave us more than feedback, it gave us a design lens rooted in real
                                    users, system constraints, and long-term impact. It also helped us appreciate the
                                    importance of clearly defined assumptions. For example, we learned that CO‚ÇÇ metrics
                                    could vary widely based on transport mode, fuel type, and location. As Sarah put it,
                                    ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot; it depends on car type, size, shape, and more.‚Äù Instead of trying to
                                    find a perfect formula, she advised us to use an average of the available average
                                    metrics and explain it clearly. This reinforced an important insight: on
                                    community-driven platforms, transparency often matters more than technical
                                    precision.
                                </p>

                                <p>Through our interactions, several core themes emerged that directly influenced our
                                    final prototype:</p>
                                <ul class="reflection-list">
                                    <li>Clarifying assumptions early allows creativity to flourish within defined
                                        boundaries</li>
                                    <li>Gamification is only effective when aligned with user intention and context</li>
                                    <li>User retention relies on clarity, immediacy, and feedback, not just features
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Designing with stakeholders leads to stronger outcomes than designing for them
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>These weren‚Äôt just theoretical learnings, they were translated into specific design
                                    changes, such as simplifying UI icons, improving leaderboard access and focusing
                                    rewards on both fun and function. Our final design, while playful, is grounded in
                                    behavioural insight, stakeholder context, and community science values.</p>

                                <p>Ultimately, our collaboration with GALLANT shaped not just our product, but our
                                    entire design process. We moved from assumption to alignment, from isolated ideation
                                    to shared ownership, and from feature-driven design to purpose-driven interaction.
                                    Sarah didn‚Äôt simply guide us, she partnered with us in building a solution that was
                                    not only engaging, but meaningful, implementable, and grounded in the lived reality
                                    of both users and system constraints.

                                    in the value of listening deeply, iterating honestly, and staying flexible in the
                                    face of evolving feedback. It is this process and not just the final product, that
                                    we are most proud of.

                        we created was not just a product of design decisions but the result of open dialogue, critical
                        reflection, and iterative learning. We approached the challenge with curiosity and ambition, but
                        also with the humility to question our assumptions and change direction when needed.

                                    <h4>Clarity of Focus Through Iteration</h4>
                                    <p>One of the accomplishments we are most proud of was how our team was able to
                                        pivot from a fun-focused concept to a purpose-driven experience. Initially
                                        inspired by gamification-heavy models like Pok√©mon Go, our early ideas leaned
                                        toward entertaining features like interactive AR pets, collectible creatures and
                                        fighting of ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù. But through discussions with our stakeholder, we came to
                                        recognize that excessive playfulness could dilute the core goal of encouraging
                                        climate-positive travel.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Instead of discarding the idea entirely, we refined it by retaining a virtual pet
                                        system but grounding it in real-world behaviour change. For instance, the pet
                                        can be interacted with by "touching" it, which will subsequently produce a
                                        sound.. We learned to strike a balance between delight and direction,
                                        transforming a playful concept into a motivational tool.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Responsive, Evidence-Based Design</h4>
                                    <p>We‚Äôre proud of how we allowed stakeholder input and user insight to shape our
                                        design decisions. Our design was never static; each round of feedback led to
                                        deliberate, documented adjustments, such as simplifying UI icons, clarifying
                                        leaderboard access, and incorporating reward systems tied to verified
                                        behaviours. We didn‚Äôt just listen, we acted on feedback provided by our
                                        stakeholder.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>For example, when the stakeholder pointed out that buried features (like
                                        leaderboards and badge systems) currently lack visibility in the live app, we
                                        reorganized our layout to make those elements more prominent. Our solution
                                        emerged as a result of responsiveness, not rigid planning, and that adaptability
                                        is something we deeply value.</p>

                                    <h4>Engagement with System Constraints</h4>
                                    <p>Rather than being frustrated by limitations (like not having backend access or
                                        Spotteron‚Äôs locked infrastructure), we saw them as design constraints to work
                                        within creatively. We focused on what we could control: crafting a meaningful
                                        conceptual design layer, imagining ideal future features, and aligning them with
                                        user motivation and feasibility.</p>
                                    <p>For example, even though we couldn‚Äôt implement AR or real-time CO‚ÇÇ tracking, we
                                        mocked up plausible interactions and clearly articulated the assumptions and
                                        metrics behind them. Our prototype respects real-world constraints while
                                        offering a compelling vision of future possibilities.

                                    <p>We are also proud of our internal teamwork. Each member contributed unique
                                        perspectives, whether in UI design, concept framing, user behaviour, or
                                        stakeholder interaction. We embraced shared ownership of both successes and
                                        struggles, working cohesively through brainstorming sessions, feedback reviews,
                                        and content creation. Our ability to adapt to feedback and collectively defend
                                        or revise ideas shows maturity and respect across the team.

                                    <p>A key learning point was how we initially became overly invested in features like
                                        AR pets, evolving maps, and fully interactive avatars. While these ideas were
                                        exciting, we spent time and creative energy developing them before properly
                                        assessing feasibility. In hindsight, we could have tested assumptions earlier,
                                        explored simpler solutions, and saved effort for refining core experiences.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Although we eventually adjusted course, the early momentum around non-viable
                                        ideas delayed progress in more critical areas such as UI clarity, onboarding
                                        flows, and habit-forming feedback mechanisms.

                                    <p>While we had rich interactions with our stakeholder, our design would have
                                        benefited from broader user validation outside of GALLANT. Time constraints and
                                        scoping challenges meant we were unable to conduct field testing or broader
                                        surveys. This limited our ability to gauge how real users, especially those
                                        unfamiliar with community science projects, would engage with the app.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Though we made informed assumptions using behavioural frameworks, real-world
                                        testing would have validated (or challenged) key flows like streak progression,
                                        pet motivation, and reward incentives. It‚Äôs a gap we recognize and would
                                        prioritize in future iterations.

                                        consistency. While we eventually adopted GALLANT‚Äôs branding and visual
                                        guidelines, this decision came later in the process. Had we begun with clearer
                                        brand alignment, we could have streamlined decision-making around typography,
                                        layout, and colour contrast earlier‚Äîensuring greater cohesion from the start.

                        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                        <p>
                            We walk away from this project with a clearer understanding of how good design is not just
                            about great ideas but about thoughtful, user-aligned execution. We‚Äôve learned to embrace
                            constraints, prioritize clarity over complexity, and validate ideas with evidence, not
                            intuition. We‚Äôve also learned that meaningful collaboration, both within the team and with
                            stakeholders, is essential to shaping impactful, sustainable solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>Most importantly, we are proud that our final design does not just "look good" but tells a
                            clear story, invites user participation, and is grounded in real needs.
