                            This project is part of GALLANT‚Äôs wider efforts to promote sustainable travel in Glasgow and tracking the CO‚ÇÇ offsets achieved when users choose walking or cycling over motorised transport.
                            CommuniMap is a digital platform that allows users to log walking and cycling routes, supporting low-carbon travel habits and community research.
                            Our work explores how to enhance CommuniMap through gamification to make the experience more engaging. We framed the design process around a clear problem of low long-term user engagement, and used iterative design thinking and stakeholder input to develop and refine features like virtual pets, rewards, and streak systems. These additions are designed to create a more motivating and meaningful user experience.

                <h2> Client Insights</h2>
                <div class="problem-statement">
                        <p>From our stakeholder discussions, we learned that CommuniMap‚Äôs current gamification features such as badges and a leaderboard are too hidden and fail to engage users. To encourage consistent contributions, gamification needs to be fun, visible, and habit-forming, taking inspiration from successful apps like Duolingo with tiered leaderboards, streak systems, and group achievements. While vouchers have been effective in the past, they are not sustainable as the sole motivator, so creative, non-monetary rewards such as in-app recognition and unlockable milestones should also be considered. Above all, features should remain simple, easy to find, and intuitive to use to maximise their impact.</p>

                    <div class="problem-statement">
                        <p>The current version of CommuniMap lacks features that keep users engaged over time. While the platform allows people to log their walking and cycling routes, users often lose interest due to limited interactivity and a lack of feedback or rewards. Speaking to the client, we found out that while some gamification features like leaderboards already exist, they are hidden or underutilized. Without meaningful motivation or visible feedback, even the most well-intentioned users stop contributing, reducing the platform's long-term value as a community tool.</p>

                            <p>We started by trying to understand the problem. At first, we thought it was just about making the app more fun. But after speaking with our stakeholder, we realised it was more about making the existing features feel meaningful and engaging.</p>
                            
                            <p>What we assumed users wanted didn't always match reality. For example, features like badges and leaderboards were already in the app, but they were hidden and not very motivating. This helped us reframe our thinking. Instead of simply adding gamification, we began asking how to make it feel purposeful and visible.</p>
                            
                            <p>We also learned the importance of shared understanding. Terms like "fun" or "rewarding" meant different things to different people, so we had to align our ideas before moving forward. We reintroduced CO‚ÇÇ tracking as a conceptual metric based on stakeholder approval. While not currently implemented due to cost, we included it in our design with simplified assumptions to demonstrate potential.</p>

                            <p>Once we had a clearer direction, we began sketching and prototyping different ideas. We created low-fidelity mockups and interactive Figma screens to test out things like map-following pets, daily streaks, and more visible rewards.</p>
                            
                            <p>This wasn't just about showing designs. Building these prototypes helped us figure out what actually made sense and what didn't. Some ideas looked good in theory but were confusing in practice. Others, like simpler progress feedback or small interactions, turned out to be more effective than we expected.</p>
                            
                            <p>We shared our designs with our stakeholder and gathered feedback. This helped us refine the direction further and focus on what really worked.</p>

                            <p>In this phase, we started refining the designs. We made the interface cleaner, adjusted the layout for better flow, and focused on how the app feels to use. We worked on making features like the leaderboard easier to find, and matched the tone of the app to be more playful while still clear and usable.</p>
                            
                            <p>We also started thinking about how to balance creative ideas with real-world limitations, like technical restrictions or platform constraints. We also adapted our visual design to align with the CommuniMap brand guidelines to ensure consistency with the existing app. Our goal is to design something that's not just fun to look at, but genuinely enjoyable to use.</p>
                            
                            <p>Instead of focusing only on features, we're shaping the overall experience. We want to create something that people will want to return to and feel connected with over time.</p>

                        Throughout this project, we gained valuable insights into the complexities of designing engaging digital experiences. From understanding user motivations to balancing functionality with fun, our journey revealed the importance of iterative design and stakeholder collaboration. The process taught us that successful gamification goes beyond adding game elements‚Äîit requires thoughtful integration that enhances rather than distracts from the core purpose.
