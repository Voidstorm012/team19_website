                            This project is part of GALLANT‚Äôs wider efforts to promote sustainable travel in Glasgow and
                            tracking the CO‚ÇÇ offsets achieved when users choose walking or cycling over motorised
                            transport.
                            CommuniMap is a digital platform that allows users to log walking and cycling routes,
                            supporting low-carbon travel habits and community research.
                            Our work explores how to enhance CommuniMap through gamification to make the experience more
                            engaging. We framed the design process around a clear problem of low long-term user
                            engagement, and used iterative design thinking and stakeholder input to develop and refine
                            features like virtual pets, rewards, and streak systems. These additions are designed to
                            create a more motivating and meaningful user experience.

                        <p>From our stakeholder discussions, we learned that CommuniMap‚Äôs current gamification features such as badges and a leaderboard are too hidden and fail to engage users. To encourage consistent contributions, gamification needs to be fun, visible, and habit-forming, taking inspiration from successful apps like Duolingo with tiered leaderboards, streak systems, and group achievements. While vouchers have been effective in the past, they are not sustainable as the sole motivator, so creative, non-monetary rewards such as in-app recognition and unlockable milestones should also be considered. Above all, features should remain simple, easy to find, and intuitive to use to maximise their impact.</p>

                        <p>The current version of CommuniMap lacks features that keep users engaged over time. While the platform allows people to log their walking and cycling routes, users often lose interest due to limited interactivity and a lack of feedback or rewards. Speaking to the client, we found out that while some gamification features like leaderboards already exist, they are hidden or underutilized. Without meaningful motivation or visible feedback, even the most well-intentioned users stop contributing, reducing the platform's long-term value as a community tool.</p>

                                    We explored several gamified and sustainability-focused apps to identify best
                                    practices and gaps. Duolingo inspired our use of tiered leaderboards and streak
                                    systems to encourage daily engagement. Pok√©mon Go demonstrated how 2D/3D hybrid maps
                                    and location-based interactions can turn movement into an immersive experience.
                                    LumiHealth showed the effectiveness of daily challenges and earning coins that can
                                    be redeemed for real-world rewards. However, most platforms lacked visible CO‚ÇÇ
                                    impact gaps we aimed to address with CommuniMap.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <p>We began the project by interpreting the brief through the lens of CO‚ÇÇ tracking.
                                Initially, we focused on researching the best ways to calculate and visualize carbon
                                savings, thinking this would create the most impact. However, after speaking with our
                                stakeholder, we realised this wasn't the app‚Äôs core problem.</p>


                            <p>The real issue was around engagement. Features like badges and leaderboards already
                                existed, but were buried or felt disconnected from the user's experience. This shifted
                                our focus: instead of adding new elements blindly, we asked ourselves how we could make
                                features feel purposeful, visible, and emotionally meaningful.</p>
                            <p>We explored existing gamification approaches ‚Äî like reward loops, pet companions, social
                                progression ‚Äî and analysed why some failed while others worked. From this, we drafted
                                several ideas before narrowing it down to five final features that best balanced
                                motivation, usability, and feasibility.</p>

                            <!-- <p>We also learned the importance of shared understanding. Terms like "fun" or "rewarding"
                                meant different things to different people, so we had to align our ideas before moving
                                forward. We reintroduced CO‚ÇÇ tracking as a conceptual metric based on stakeholder
                                approval. While not currently implemented due to cost, we included it in our design with
                                simplified assumptions to demonstrate potential.</p> -->

                            <p>Once we understood that the core issue wasn‚Äôt just a lack of features, but the lack of
                                visible and meaningful engagement, we aligned on a clearer direction: to enhance
                                intuitiveness and motivation without overwhelming users.
                            </p>

                            <p>We created low-fidelity mockups and interactive Figma screens to prototype ideas such as
                                app-following pets, daily streaks, visible rewards, and achievement popups. These ideas
                                aimed to make sustainable actions feel rewarding in a more obvious, interactive way.

                            </p>

                            <p> This wasn‚Äôt just about designing visuals, building prototypes helped us figure out what
                                actually felt intuitive,
                                fun, or confusing. Some concepts looked good on paper but fell flat in testing.
                                Interestingly, simpler elements
                                like visible streak counters, progress feedback, or small positive reinforcements turned
                                out to be more effective than larger,
                                more complex ideas.</p>

                            <p>We shared our designs with our stakeholder and gathered feedback. This helped us refine
                                the direction further and focus on what really worked.</p>

                            <p>In this phase, we moved from mid-fidelity concepts to high-fidelity designs, focusing on
                                refining both the interface and the overall user experience. We cleaned up the layout,
                                improved navigation flow, and worked on making key features like the leaderboard easier
                                to access. The tone of the app shifted to be more playful while maintaining clarity and
                                usability.</p>

                            <p>At this stage, we produced what we considered our second final implementation a
                                near-complete set of Figma mockups that brought together our chosen features with the
                                CommuniMap brand style before comfirming with the client one last time. However, after
                                reviewing this version, we identified areas for further refinement, such as more
                                cohesive visual hierarchy, improved accessibility, and smoother micro-interactions.</p>

                            <p>We also carefully balanced creativity with real-world limitations like technical
                                feasibility, ensuring our ideas could be realistically implemented. The result was a
                                polished design that not only looked good but also felt intuitive and rewarding to use.

                             After receiving feedback from our client, we refined the final UI to improve clarity, visual hierarchy, and overall user flow. We adapted the theme colour to match the Gallant colour palette, removed human avatars to focus solely on pets (which adapt based on the user‚Äôs country ‚Äî e.g., Singapore features a lion, while Glasgow features a highland cow),     and introduced small pop-up alerts for active events happening nearby. These adjustments made the interface more engaging, locally relevant, and aligned with CommuniMap‚Äôs branding.

                        Throughout this project, we gained valuable insights into the complexities of designing engaging
                        digital experiences. From understanding user motivations to balancing functionality with fun,
                        our journey revealed the importance of iterative design and stakeholder collaboration. The
                        process taught us that successful gamification goes beyond adding game elements‚Äîit requires
                        thoughtful integration that enhances rather than distracts from the core purpose.

                <div class="retrospective-content">
                    <p class="retrospective-intro">
                        Looking back on our project journey, we take pride not only in the final prototype but also in
                        the thoughtfulness, adaptability, and integrity of the process that led us there. The solution
                        we created was not just a product of design decisions but the result of open dialogue, critical
                        reflection, and iterative learning. We approached the challenge with curiosity and ambition, but
                        also with the humility to question our assumptions and change direction when needed.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What We're Proud Of</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using low-fidelity prototypes to quickly align our shared mental models with the
                            stakeholder‚Äôs expectations.</li>
                        <li>Reframing our early ‚Äúfun-first‚Äù ideas into purposeful interactions that support behavior
                            change.</li>
                        <li>Turning vague feedback into actionable, testable Figma flows (especially around rewards and
                            pet evolution).</li>
                        <li>Adapting and simplifying our streak system to be motivational without feeling like a
                            gimmick.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>üí≠ What We Struggled With</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Over-designing early ideas (like AR or animated pets) before grounding them in feasibility.
                        </li>
                        <li>Assuming our idea of ‚Äúfun‚Äù matched the stakeholder‚Äôs, before testing that assumption
                            properly.</li>
                        <li>Limited time for real user testing outside of stakeholder and internal feedback.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="retrospective-conclusion">
                        This process reinforced the value of co-creation. Working closely with GALLANT helped us uncover
                        blind spots early‚Äîlike how hidden rewards don‚Äôt help long-term engagement. We‚Äôre leaving this
                        project not just with a polished prototype, but with a clearer sense of how design decisions
                        shape real outcomes.
